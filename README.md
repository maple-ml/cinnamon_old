An ambitious attempt at creating a sustainable Geometry Dash mod loader.

----

**Cinnamon** is a project that aims to implement advanced modding capabilities to Geometry Dash, while providing a stable interface for advanced usage natively in Geometry Dash. Alongside providing an interactive and innovative modal for developers to work off of, it aims to create a sustainable community and environment for that of creation, and prosperity.

## Objectives
* Provide a comprehensive API for interfacing with Geometry Dash.
* Maintain an active hub for these interfaces to be posted to.
* Value performance and abstraction equally, for newer developers.
* Cover whatever is possible of Geometry Dash, server or not.

## Installation
As of writing this (Febuary 16th, 2021) there are no built binaries that can be added alongside Geometry Dash. We are currently in a **very early** stage of development, and do not expect for much to happen in a while.

### Dependencies
* [Cappuccino SDK](https://github.com/AndreNIH/CappuccinoSDK)
* [MinHook](https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook/)
* [fmtlib 7.1.3](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt)
* [Python 3.9 (with debug binaries added)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Development
When developing or debugging Cinnamon or any associated projects, a few prerequesites needed are:
* An IDE that supports working with C++ (standard revision 2017) with proper IntelliSense; primarily [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/), for the .sln
* A compiler that can handle C++17, and Windows headers; such as MSVC.

### Source Code
You are able to clone the repository over command line, or by downloading it. Updating this code to the latest commit would be done with `git pull`, inside the tau directory.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/maple-ml/cinnamon
cd cinnamon
```

### Building
We have not written a building guide, as this project is primarily self-explanatorily built using [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) and MSVC.
This section will be community managed, otherwise.

## Contributions
All contributions are appreciated, as to improve the mode on its playability and functionality. As this project isn't perfect, we would enjoy all additions to the code through bugfixing and ideas. Contributions should be done over an issue or a pull request, to give maintainers a chance to review changes to the codebase.

For new ideas and features, we would prefer for you to write an issue before trying to add it to show the maintainers.

## License
As of right now, Cinnamon has no license. All of the projects used here have their own licenses, and any packed dependency will have their license provided in the [incl](https://github.com/maple-ml/cinnamon/tree/master/incl) folder for your convenience.
